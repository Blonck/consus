# consus - library for weigted histogram analysis method (WHAM) of time series generated by Metropolis Monte Carlo simulations
## at the moment this library is very preliminary

A bunch of header files are located under src/ which can be used to generate
the density of states $\Omega$ and calculate expectation values based on $\Omega$.
* src/ - a few generic classes and functions
* src/WHAM2D - functions for generating $\Omega(E_1, E_2)$ and calculating expectation values
* src/data - functions to read in data

In exe/ you can find some examples how to use the library
* exe/WHAM2D - two-dimensional wheighted histogram analysis
* exe/WHAM2D/NVT - 2D-WHAM for the NVT ensemble (time series from canonical simulations)
